Do you maybe use the code-owners plugin, which does support this syntax?\nFor the code-owners plugin it\u0027s already mentioned in the syntax documentation that branches can be specified [1].\n\n[1] https://android-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/backend-find-owners.html#file-keyword",
